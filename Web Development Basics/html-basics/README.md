Notice in the browser, how each element takes up the entire width of the page. This is because heading tags (the h1’s, and h2’s) and paragraph tags (the p’s) are both block-level elements.

In other words, block elements take up the entire width of their parent elements (in this case, their parent is the body tag).

Common HTML Tags
First, if you have anything inside your body element delete it so we can start fresh. The most common tags are:
div
h1, h2, … h6
p
ul/ol, li (they go together)
span
img
a
input
button

block elements block elements take up the entire width of their parent elements (in this case, their parent is the body tag). <h1> <div>

inline elements inline elements only take up as much space as they need - span tag did not take up the width of its parent. This is because span elements are inline and they… well, fall in line with their surrounding elements. <span>

HTML elements may be given "attributes". <p id="title">The Weather</p>

Buttons and inputs "Buttons and inputs are inline by default
– You can nest them in a div to make them take a new line"
